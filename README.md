# Clifford Carnmo
Director of Engineering. Passionate about engineering leadership and culture, programming and the demoscene.

For almost 20 years I have been building and leading software engineering teams while coaching engineers through their personal growth and development. I strongly believe in servant leadership and the advantage of motivated, engaged, and empowered people in a creative environment and culture. My extensive tech industry experience allows me to credibly lead, coach and motivate as a role model in words and actions.

## Leadership profile
* Active, clear, confident, and explicit leadership that promotes engagement and personal development through positive and constructive feedback and coaching.
* Situational and agile servant leadership in engineering contexts and organizations.
* Purpose-driven leadership based on empathy, trust, interaction, and collaboration.
* Governance, recruiting, staffing, and retaining highly competent engineering teams.
* Inspiring, diverse, and inclusive engineering environments where perspectives are valued, ideas welcome and where goals are reached and celebrated together.
* Ability to adapt and switch between strategic, tactical, and operational contexts.
* Experience in due diligence, C- & D-suites, board of directors, management teams.
* Facilitating and maintaining consistent and successful cross-functional interfaces and peer partnerships with surrounding contexts and stakeholders.

## Key drivers and motivation
I get my energy from managing and evolving highly functioning engineering- and software development teams. I measure my success in other peopleâ€™s success and their ability to excel at work. To live is to learn and I enjoy sharing knowledge and learning together with others. After 30 years in the tech industry, I still love every day I get to work with brilliant people on challenging projects.
